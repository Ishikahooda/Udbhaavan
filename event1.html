      <h2>Greenovation</h2>
      <div class="separetor2"></div>
      <p>
  In a bid to transform our world to a better version of itself, United Nations has piloted its campaign of 17
  Sustainable Development Goals.<br>

  Taking this forward, we want the future generation to be well informed and concerned so that they can
  contribute their innovative, green and sustainable solutions to the posed environmental threats around
  the planet.<br>
  This event will expose the kids to the concept of sustainable development along with a sense of
  achievement as they solve real life case studies applying their innovation and problem solving skills.<br>
<div style="color:#e84c3d">Event Guidelines:</div>
  Participants have to work upon the proposed sustainable development goals, presenting the
  causes and the impact and then work upon green solutions for the same. They will be provided
  with some case studies as reference which they can use. However,participants are free to drive
  their imagination and utilize their awareness to pick and solve any other environmental issue.<br><br>
<div style="color:#e84c3d">Required Steps:</div>
  1. Form a team of maximum 4 participants.
  2. Select a problem/ pick a case study.
  3. Analyze the problem for its causes, impact and possible solutions.
  4. Shortlist a solution that is the most efficient ( data required ) and sustainable.
  5. Prepare a working model/ non-working model/ a presentation of your proposed
  solution.
  6. A written document on the research on case study and proposed solution is a must. The
  teams will be disqualified without the project report.
  7. The solution shall then be presented on the day of the event by the participants.
  * The entire journey of the solution development should be documented( in the form of report,
  pictures, video etc. ) and submitted on the day of the event.<br><br>
<div style="color:#e84c3d">Judgement Criteria:</div>
  1. Working models will be given an edge.
  2. Solution models that kept every factor of the case study ( or the problem chosen ) in
  consideration shall be given a preference
  3. Judgement shall be based on :
  a. Ability to solve the problem
  b. Efficiency of the solution
  c. Sustainability of the solution
  d. Research of the problem and presentation( documentation and expression ) of
  the solution.<br><br>

<div style="color:#e84c3d">Rules:</div>
  1. Only ONE team from a school can participate in a particular event.
  2. There should be no more than 4 participants in a team.
  3. Each team will be given 5 minutes to present their solution.

	<div style="color:#e84c3d">Case studies for reference:</div>
	<ul><li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 1:</div>
	[SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation] Ladakh is a cold desert and during winter agriculture is not
	practiced due to frozen ground soil and low air temperature. During spring season, water requirement
	for sowing increases whereas streams dry up. With annual rainfall of less than 50 millimetres (2.0 in),
	agriculture in Ladakh is solely dependent on snow and glacier meltwater. Due to climate change, the
	region experiences hotter summers with increase in melts along with shift in the timing and
	precipitation of the melts. Subsequently, during the spring season water is more scarce which in turn
	impacts agriculture and food supplies. Can you solve this problem?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 2:</div>
	[SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation] An average woman will use around 16,000 or more tampons or
	pads in her lifetime. That’s 7 billion tampons and pads landing in landfills each year. Most of them
	contain chemicals, toxins, additives and synthetic materials such as plastic. The plastics, first of all, take a
	very long time to breakdown. Second, they also end up leaking into nature, and polluting our rivers,
	lakes, streams and world. How can we make hygienic, yet environment friendly solutions for women?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 3:</div>
	[SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation] No house in Sangam Vihar, a concrete maze of newly constructed
	shops and houses, has a water meter. And that’s because no one in the entire colony has an official
	connection for water.<br>
	The residents of the colony are dependent on illegal tankers and pipelines for fulfilling their water
	needs. How can we make clean water available to everyone in Sangam Vihar?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 4:</div>
	[SDG 14 - Life Below Water] For the past 25 years, factories in the neighbouring industrial belt of Lote
	Parshuram in Maharashtra have been dumping untreated effluents in the river, destroying all living
	forms in it. The fish are dying and the river no longer offers a livelihood option for fishermen in the
	village. How can we keep our rivers clean?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 5:</div>
	[SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy] Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or
	electronic devices. Electronic scrap components, such as CPUs, contain potentially harmful components
	such as lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated flame retardants. India has emerged as fifth largest
	Electronic waste producer in world.</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 6:</div>
	[SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production] Amazon, the largest e-commerce platform in the
	world, offers a one-day delivery option to its customers. Sometimes, there is a vehicle availed to deliver
	a single pair of socks. This can aggravate the problem of pollution caused by vehicles. How can we stop
	the atmospheric pollution caused by vehicles, while still keeping the ease of e-commerce platforms
	intact.</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 7:</div>
	[SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production] More than 2.5m disposable cups have been
	purchased by the UK’s environment department for use in its restaurants and cafes over the past five
	years – equivalent to nearly 1,400 a day. Most of these are not recycled and end up in landfills. This is
	taking a toll on our environment and the amount of waste that we are producing. Can you solve this
	problem?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 8:</div>
	[SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production] During Ganesh Chaturthi, millions of idols of Lord
	Ganesh are immersed in water bodies to pay respect to the God. These idols are made out of Plaster of
	Paris (PoP) i.e. calcium sulphate hemihydrate. It takes several months to totally dissolve Ganesh Idols
	made up of PoP into water.<br>
	Also, colors used in decoration of idols contains harmful chemicals containing mercury, lead which leaks
	into water as idol dissolves. It increases acid content, Total Dissolved solids (TDS) and Heavy metals in
	water. It kills aquatic plants and marine life, damaging ecosystem underwater. How can you stop this
	damage being done in the name of worship?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 9:</div>
	[SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy] We hear about how ice caps around the world are melting. We
	see how our winters are getting less chilly and summers are getting harsher. Delhi saw a maximum
	temperature of 49 degrees this year. Yet Donald Trump, the president of the United States, a country
	that influences the whole world at large, believes that climate change is a hoax. What do you think
	about global warming? Can you help solve the problem?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 10:</div>
	[SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy] Argayash, a small town in Russia, has become one of the world’s
	biggest nuclear radiation emitters. Nuclear radiations. Radioactive materials cause mutations in the
	DNA, hence causing cancer. How do we avoid/ contain such problems?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 11:</div>
	[SDG 15: Life on Land] Last year the world lost an area of forest the size of New Zealand last year. It is
	clear that it is not just the indigenous people who are at risk. Let’s solve this problem before it's too
	late?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 12:</div>
	[SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy] Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning are on the rise
	again in 2017 after three years of stability between 2014 and 2016. The global CO2 emissions from all
	human activities will reach 41 billion tons in 2017, following a projected 2 percent rise in burning fossil
	fuels. These carbon emissions raise global temperatures by trapping solar energy in the atmosphere.
	This alters water supplies and weather patterns, changes the growing season for food crops and
	threatens coastal communities with increasing sea levels. How do we contain CO2 emissions?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 13:</div>
	[SDG 15: Life on Land] Rapidly depleting levels of groundwater is one of the biggest threat to food
	security and livelihood in the country. Accessing the groundwater has become increasingly difficult over
	the decades. According to news reports, excessive exploitation of limited groundwater resources for
	irrigation of cash crops such as sugarcane has caused a 6 percentage point decline in the availability of
	water within 10 metres from ground level. Low rainfall and drought are also reasons for groundwater
	depletion. The north western and southeastern parts of the country are the worst hit. These are also the
	regions responsible for most of the country’s agricultural production and food crisis is a natural
	corollary. How do we avoid this crisis?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 14:</div>
	[SDG 15: Life on Land] According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red Data Book,
	some 47 species of plants and animals in India are listed as critically endangered. Loss of ecology and
	natural habitats have left many indigenous species, including important ones such as the Siberian crane,
	Himalayan wolf and Kashmir stag in grave danger of going extinct. Rapid urbanization, poaching and
	indiscriminate hunting for leather fur etc. have rendered these animals critically endangered and the
	flora or herbal treasure of India in near-extinction conditions. Many of the plants commonly harvested
	for their medicinal properties are vanishing along with the legacy of Ayurvedic treatment. What should
	we do to protect our biodiversity?</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 15:</div>
	[SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy] The sun offers the most abundant, reliable and pollution free
	source of power in the world. However, expensive cost and inconsistent availability prevent it from
	being optimally used. To harvest more of this free energy, we need to discover new materials, develop
	new production techniques and solve the problem of storing energy when the sun isn't shining. Develop
	an innovative idea for this.</li>

	<li><div style="color:#36a99a">Case Study 16:</div>
	[SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure] Excessive use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers are
	harming the food quality and productivity at a large scale and in turn is hazardous to human health.
	Presence of DDT pesticides and lead content in vegetables have been frequently reaching the headlines.
	How can you change this?</li></ul></p><br>
